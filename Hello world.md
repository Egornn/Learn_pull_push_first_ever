For saving the data in GIT I have to use the following commands:
1. git add #file_name
        
        1. git commit -m "message inscribing the changes"

In order to change to previous **commit**  of a file I need to:
1. git log 
2. git checkout #hash sum of the version

In order to get back 
* git checkout master

You can check the difference before the commit
* git diff
